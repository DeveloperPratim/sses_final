        "     \"student_answer\": \"Inter-process communication (IPC) refers to the methods used by processes to exchange data and synchronize their activities. It is important for multi-process systems, where processes often need to share information or coordinate actions. IPC can be achieved using mechanisms like shared memory, message queues, semaphores, or sockets. While IPC is powerful, it requires careful management to avoid issues like deadlock or race conditions, which can lead to unpredictable behavior or system crashes.\",\n",

        "    {\"question\": \"What is the significance of a kernel in an operating system?\",\n",
        "     \"student_answer\": \"The kernel is the core part of the operating system that manages system resources such as CPU, memory, and input/output devices. It acts as a bridge between applications and hardware, ensuring that processes run smoothly and that resources are allocated efficiently. The kernel is responsible for low-level tasks like memory management, process scheduling, and interrupt handling. A well-designed kernel can significantly improve the overall performance and stability of an operating system.\",\n",
        "     \"expected_answer\": \"The kernel is the core part of the OS that manages system resources and provides essential services for programs.\",\n",

        "    {\"question\": \"What is memory management?\",\n",
        "     \"student_answer\": \"Memory management is the process of managing the computer's memory resources, ensuring that each program and process gets the memory it needs to function. This includes tasks such as allocating memory for processes, tracking memory usage, and swapping data between RAM and disk storage when necessary. Effective memory management is critical for system performance, as poor memory handling can lead to issues like fragmentation or memory leaks, which can slow down or crash the system.\",\n",
        "     \"expected_answer\": \"Memory management involves the process of controlling and coordinating computer memory, including the allocation and deallocation of memory blocks.\",\n",

        "    {\"question\": \"What are device drivers?\",\n",
        "     \"student_answer\": \"Device drivers are specialized programs that enable the operating system to communicate with and control hardware devices. They act as a translator between the hardware and the operating system, converting general OS commands into device-specific instructions. For example, a printer driver translates print commands into a format the printer understands. Without device drivers, the operating system would not be able to interact with hardware peripherals, making them essential for system functionality.\",\n",
